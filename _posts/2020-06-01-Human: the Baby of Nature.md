I was once nature herself:
As vast as the milky way
As small as a sand
As light as a breeze
As heavy as the mountains
As bright as the sun
As dark as the deep of night
As young as the first green of spring
As old as the farthest stars

Until 
I was borne a human baby
I'm since then a baby of nature
The sun is my father
The air is my mother
Everything else is my brothers and sisters
Nothing that I fear
I'm pure and carefree
I'm natural
As I am a baby of nature

The day I should die as a human
I merely 
Go back to nature
Become again nature herself
In every living form
As vast as the milky way
As small as a sand
As light as a breeze
As heavy as the mountains
As bright as the sun
As dark as the deep of night
As young as the first green of sping
As old as the farthest stars
