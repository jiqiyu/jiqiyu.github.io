![sloth](http://www.piguban.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sloth.jpg)

i'm slothful, sadly! i read the book sloth so that i can understand myself a bit more.

i consider this book a satire on 21st centuary the modern society, for more and more people among us are getting slothful. as wendy wasserstein, the author of the book, said


<blockquote>sloth is the fastest-growing lifestyle movement in the world.</blockquote>


and,


<blockquote>what's so great about the sloth plan, and why this plan is the fastest growing lifestyle change in the civilized world, is once you've got the idea, it can apply to every aspect of your life, not just exercise.</blockquote>


yes, sloth can easily infiltrate every aspect of our life.

though this book is not a serious analysis of sloth, it did make us look into sloth more clearly: excuses the sloths like to use such as "there is no real hope for change. power is in the hands of an elite, entitled few, and there is no reason to waste our lives howling in the wilderness.", things the sloths like to do such as watching lots of glossy TV miniseries and soaps, cluttering mind with nonsense, etc. look at the following several episodes about some sloths' behavior described in the book which are sharp irony of sloth lifestyle, and will absolutely make you laugh out.


<blockquote>while you're slothing, it might be enjoyable to paint your toes as the day's activity, nail painting fits perfectly into the sloth's regimen because it requires almost no energy expenditure, and it renders your hands or feet inoperable while the polish is drying.</blockquote>




<blockquote>also may i suggest my full line of facial masks, some of which need to be left on for seven days, for instance, my dead sea moisturizing mask, which will exfoliate your skin back to when you were still in the womb, takes two days to apply and five days to cingeal. i also had hand cream, body cream, and lip cream, and lip mustache remover. in addition, i am planning to introduce this fall an entire line of hair products. while slothing, there's no harm in enriching your highlights with long-lasting deep color, revitalizing your roots, and increasing your hair's body and shine.</blockquote>




<blockquote>cybersloth games can also aid in plateaus. i have developed two thousand solitaire variations, and an equal amount of tetris games..........</blockquote>




<blockquote>warning: don't fall in love! remember that ture love often can cause passion, and passion is the biggest enemy of sloth. passion inevitably leads to bitterness. and sloths are a contented lot.</blockquote>


i have to say this book is not that serious, but after all, isn't this a funny book to read? besides, after reading this book i may not do those kind of nonsensical and boring things, cos doing that would remind me of this book, and i'll laugh at myself.
