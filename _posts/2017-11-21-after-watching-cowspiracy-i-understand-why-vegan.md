This is a shock, there are this huge information/knowledge gap that I didn't realize before. Livestock industry? Never thought about it before… I mean, these figures are appalling! It reminds me that, actually, the information/knowledge gap has always been in the way in environment protection, along with the ignorance and the deny. Those three factors in my opinion, have always been the biggest patrons to the plight of environment protection.

First is the gap, most of us have no idea of the situations; Then it's the ignorance and the deny. There's a saying that you can never wake up a person who pretends to be asleep. This is somehow exactly what we face when we talk about environment protection. Even that we know what's happening, still it will be extremely hard to change a thing, especially in this case, cattle, farms, dairy, livestock… not one of these things isn't related to our fundamental lifestyle. Getting together, meat on the table, milk in jugs, and wines, beers, this has been a beautiful image in our heads for as long as we can remember; Or a smiley person goes into a cafe, asking the waiter how are you today, may I please grab a bacon and egg breakfast… It's always there, when you view things from the macro data versus from the micro individual life, the contrast is always there. In fact, despite of the appalling facts, we just want to live our comfortable life till the end. Speaking of the end, we have plenty of scientific films on how human beings push ourselves to an end, how we have to abandon our planet earth, to flee to another horriblely uncomfortable planet, how we will talk about earth to our future generations who never see planet earth… We kinda live with the fact that humans are inevitably bad and earth are inevitably ruined by us, it's becoming a joke which won't hurt anybody, we end up doing nothing about it. That's the other end of ignorance I'm saying.

Lastly, the deny, there's this theory that I've heard of that the universe is huge, infinite, human beings are just nothing compare to this hugeness, therefore human behaviour can not even change the environment, all the discussions on environmental changes are nonsense, which only shows us how arrogant human beings are. Instead we can do whatever we want to and not to worry about ruin the earth, simply because we can't ruin anything, we are just nothing. Well, no, we can't ruin the universe, what we can do is, we can set our houses on fire, and burn ourselves to death, you know, things like that. Anyways, don't deny our capabilities, yes, we are capable of killing ourselves. And another fact I've been knowing is that humans are the No.1 dominant species on the planet, that is something, reminds me of dinosaurs.

After watching this, I understand why people go vegan. vegan or not, it's a personal decision though, no one should force another individual's personal decisions. However when it comes to political decisions, we must always do what we can to force it to the right decision. If there's a problem, the policy makers must address it systematically. As an individual, there's one thing I've been trying to avoid which is "knowing without doing", it's hard but I'm trying, that is to say, I'll do my bits.
