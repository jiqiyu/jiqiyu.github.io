As the title said, here's what I'm saying, the tiny trick: visit local files via opera mobile on your phone. To do this, you just type "file://localhost/location-to-the-local-file/" in your opera mobile's address bar, for example, "file://localhost/e:/", then you'll see the browser list the files and folders on your SD card.

Have you ever tried this? But before answering anything, why should we using opera mobile to visit file instead of other software? Is it necessary? My answer to this is sometimes it's necessary while other time isn't. Since I always feel that when I read e-book on my phone which is Nokia5530XM, tried many PDF reader or TXT reader, not to mention there's no free CHM reader, the user experience is far from good, but opera mobile, to the contrary, has a good user experience. It wraps text automatically, displays images nicely, zooms contents free, smooth scolling... Unfortunately, this is limited to view online sites only. Now, saying that we have a PDF or CHM book, and the same book has a online version, according to my phone, I'll choose the online version(MobiCHM crashes often while AlternateReader is good but not good enough when I have a choice), but that's to say I must have WI-FI hotspot which I can't always have when outdoor, and in my country the 3G tech is not widespead so the charge is not so cheap that everyone can afford. At such times I found above method useful. For example, I want to read the [APUE2](http://book.chinaunix.net/special/ebook/addisonWesley/APUE2/) or [Pro Git](http://progit.org/book/), CHM or PDF is not satisfied on cellphone, I just grab the whole site, maybe use wget, then put it on my cell, use opera mobile to view it. That's it.
