As I've subscribed to a new VPS recently, I then configured the server again. Fortunately, there's plenty of resources over the Internet, for further use, I write them down.



	
  1. Hardening CentOS

  2. Securing SSH

  3. Clear Shell History on Your Screen When You Logout

  4. IPTables

[http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables](http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables)
If there's other services on your server, like vpn,ftp,etc., you should configure the iptables to allow them, since you set DROP as your default policy.
The above are the most basic.
