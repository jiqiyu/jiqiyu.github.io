The primordial instinct of humans doing art, which to my opinion, is to achieve a certain kind of communication or connection, is to reach out, and to overcome. More specifically, to reach out something, we don't know what they are, but SOMETHING, something that massive, profound and meaningful; To overcome the smallness, the meaningless, the emptiness of ourselves, so that we can carry on with bravery. It is (to me anyway) the same reason as we want to know why the sun is there and the leaves are green, and all the mysteries about nature and universe; Same reason as we wanna send out those spaceships carrying those messages hoping there's someone at somewhere in the universe receive them. All these activities of our human being, the art, science, philosophy... Those things themselves are the means, and the meaning. And very poetic.
