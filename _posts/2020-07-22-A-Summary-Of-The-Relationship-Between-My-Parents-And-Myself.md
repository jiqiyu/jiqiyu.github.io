A pear tree was my father's desire
A peach tree was my mother's
Alas, I was borne, unfortunately, an apple tree

However they raised me all the same,
As a pear tree to my father 
And a peach tree to mother
Only that I am but unfortunately 
Still an apple tree

"What is this," asks Dad
"An apple," answers me.
Why?! Why apple, give me a pear.

What is this? Asks Mom.
An apple, answers me.
Why?! Why apple, give me a peach.

"I'm sorry but I am just an apple tree," says me
"Hush! How dare you say things like this?!" My parents retorted,
"Do you forget how you are brought up and everything that we did for you?!"

"Let me see the pears!" Says father
"Let me see the peaches!" Says mother
Year after year

Apple never is what they wanted
And never will be
I know it all along
Even when I was little
