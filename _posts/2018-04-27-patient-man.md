There are things that make you sigh: it's not a perfect world, not a perfect a world… and there are things too that make you think: what a wonderful day, a wonderful day! Those ups and downs make you feel what you feel, and to feel is somehow the most important thing. There are times you don't have an answer to things, there are times you don't even know what to question and you just bear the feeling, as if you're the most patient man who could wait forever and ever.
