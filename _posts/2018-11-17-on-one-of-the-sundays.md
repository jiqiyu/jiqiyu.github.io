Daisy sat herself comfortably in front of the TV, the lights from the TV screen lightened up her face, as well as a small part of the room. She had a bag of crisps in her hand.

Just before this, she went to the supermarket, bought crisps, M&Ms, and a huge bottle of Fanta. Then she walked home. She walked those long and dark streets. However that’s just how she felt. The streets were not long, not so dark either. There were lights, and the elongated shadows of trees and buildings on the asphalt surface. Probly the fact that she hadn’t spoken to anybody for a while, actually since Friday night, had affected her feels about things. 

It was a Sunday. She didn’t have to go to work or anything. She could stay in her room all day without going out which she almost did. But at quite late of the day, she persuaded herself to go out to the supermarkets, which was only hundreds of metres away from her house, to buy some snacks. Neither had she talked to anyone during the whole shopping process. They’ve made it so convenient, you just pick your stuff on the shelf, then you go self-checkout, then you go home. And then——, we are right back to the beginning. We have Daisy sat on her sofa in front of her TV with crisps in her hand.

It was a normal weekend day, nothing special. A couple of hours later, Daisy felt she was ready to go to bed. She turned off the TV. Darkness and silence set in. She walked to her bedroom, didn’t bother to turn on the light. She sat herself down on the edge of her bed, took off her socks, pants, and her clothes, and lastly her bra which she had put them on only when she went out to the supermarket. Then just before she was to lie down, there was one nanosecond, she felt the feels. The feels that she couldn’t describe with words. It’s just there. You couldn’t escape from it, neither could you bear with it. It’s simply unbearable. It’s like an abyss that had a pair of eyes, was staring at you; It’s like the darkness and silence had suddenly substituted the air, and you were in a desperate vacuum.

Fortunately it didn’t last, it was just a nanosecond which had made her stopped her movements for probly a few secs. Then she carried on, lied down in her bed, and closed her eyes, but most importantly, let in the sleep. Now whether she knew it or not, she did the right thing, that is when the abyss stares at you, you never stare back, not with your eyes, nor with your minds!
