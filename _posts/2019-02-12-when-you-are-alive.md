When you're alive
You can close your eyes and you can open it again
You can stand up, you can walk out a door, you can wander around the street
You can make a sound or keep silent
You can change your mind
You can feel things
You can feel I wanna die this sec and the next
You can feel you may want to live
Your mind constantly changes because you are alive
You're free
You're not restrained from anything except that
The only restrictions are that you have to eat and you have to sleep
You can always make something delicious for yourself
And you can relax and close your eyes when you sleep
And you can open your eyes again when you're awake
