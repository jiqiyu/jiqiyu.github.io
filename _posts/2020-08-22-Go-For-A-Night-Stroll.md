I'd go for a night stroll

When I feel wild
When I feel sad
When I feel lonely
When I feel small

When the angst got me

I'd go for a night stroll

I'd stare into the darkness
Let the night contain me
The silence or sounds soak me

Until the desolation and me both
Dissolve
In the air

I'd walk home
Content with myself
Knowing that the sky is high
The water runs deep
The roads wind far
