As if my life depends on it
As if there's no meaning exists beyond it
As if nothing else matters
I dive in
I swim
And swim
For how long?
I don't know
Years have gone by … 

Ah,
What else is there?
Sense finally come to me
Indeed
This IS ocean of life
I feel the sensation of a whale
I feel homed
Peace graced me
