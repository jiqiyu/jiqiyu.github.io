You have to find a way to get rid of all the bad stuff, all the negativeness, otherwise you're just gonna become a bitter person who dies bittly, you're gonna lose all your taste except the taste of bitterness. Those bad, negative things are, you know, like getting or being old, being sick, being trapped, being isolate, feeling weak, feeling small… and all that. Many of those are unavoidable by being a human. You have to find a way to your asylum, a way to forget that you're old you're sick you're weak, a way to eventually lose yourself to the wonderfulness. You must find the asylum, the passion of your life. But if you say 'I like doing something, it makes me feel good', if the degree of your 'like doing something' is not deep, not profound enough, if the feeling is not strong enough, then it can't last, it can't be your asylum.
