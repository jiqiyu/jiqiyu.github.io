I want to spread my kisses all over your face
I'd be nervous
It'd be like electricity
I want to have a tour inside and outside you
I want touch every inch of your skin
I'd be nervous
It'd be like electricity
But I'd find a place to anchor my soul
If you don't mind
I want to meet your eyes
And swim in your stare
I want you
